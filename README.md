        The new keyboard height was being read into a variable after the scrollview had already been
        adjusted. This worked when the keyboard was opening, because the scrollview is adjusted with
        the correct value a second time when the keyboard animation has finished. However, when the
        keyboard is closed, the adjustment was being made before the correct height was stored,
        leading to the scrollview being positioned as if the keyboard were still open.
